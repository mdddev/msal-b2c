# Angular 15 MSAL Angular v3 Sample

This was cloned from the official [MSAL v3 sample app](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-angular-v3-samples/angular15-sample-app) and edited to be compatible with an Azure AD B2C configuration. Also it was changed to not rely on NG-modules anymore. The client id used is the one used by Microsoft in its official [MSAL v2 B2C sample](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/samples/msal-angular-v2-samples/angular-b2c-sample-app/src/environments/environment.dev.ts), so you can readily sign in with one of your socials.

This is a standalone app and not module-based.

# Instructions

* Install dependencies: `npm install`
